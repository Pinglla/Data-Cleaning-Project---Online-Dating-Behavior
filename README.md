## Project Overview
n today's digital era, online dating apps have become a primary way for people to connect and form relationships. These platforms use various algorithms to facilitate matches, but the key factors influencing match success remain an area of interest. This project analyzes trends in online dating and identifies the factors that impact match rates. By examining user behavior and platform dynamics, the goal is to understand how different attributes contribute to match success and uncover patterns that shape online dating interactions.

However, after cleaning the data, significant limitations were identified. The dataset was found to be unreliable, as the records for male users were limited, and the analyzed trends for female users contradicted real-world expectations. As a result, the findings lack meaningful insights, and this dataset is not suitable for understanding the complexities of online dating systems.
